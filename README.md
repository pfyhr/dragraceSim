A simulator to find desired wheeltorque curves for vehicles
The Python code is now quite fast thanks to @vakuj and some assistance from @najmehabiri, resulting in:

```
NP:       0.1813 s
Vanilla:  0.1791 s
MATLAB:   0.3651 s
Gradient: 0.0175 s
```

## Running GUI
The GUI is now ready-ish for testing!
run it by invoking
```
$ python flaskpage.py
```
Then point your browser to 127.0.0.1:5000, fill in the boxes and click run to see your result.
Please post any bugs/issues you find as comments to this repo :)
