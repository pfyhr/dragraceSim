A simulator to find desired wheeltorque curves for vehicles

The GUI branch and its sub branch jsplots aim for the simplest possible flask gui, with some Chart.JS plotting.

The Python code is now quite fast thanks to @vakuj and some assistance from @najmehabiri, resulting in:

```
NP:       0.1813 s
Vanilla:  0.1791 s
MATLAB:   0.3651 s
